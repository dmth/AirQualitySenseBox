This library belong to the AirQualityEgg Project.

It was extended to work with the AirQuality Sensor Shields in Version 1.4!

The crucial method is:



EggBus.h
  uint32_t getSensorValueOneDotFour(uint8_t sensorIndex);
  
EggBus.cpp
  /*
   *1.4 Sensor Shields
   *returns the sensor value of the index as a 32-bit integer
  */
  uint32_t EggBus::getSensorValueOneDotFour(uint8_t sensorIndex){
    i2cGetValue(currentBusAddress, SENSOR_DATA_BASE_OFFSET + sensorIndex * SENSOR_DATA_ADDRESS_BLOCK_SIZE + SENSOR_TABLE_Y_SCALER_OFFSET, 4);
    return buf_to_value(buffer);
  }
